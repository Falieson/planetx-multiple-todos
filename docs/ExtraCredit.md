For Learners / Tutorial makers, here's an assignment styled look at what will be accomplished in this branch ( 5/extraCredit/task_expiration ).

# 1. Task Expiration
"Remove task from display if task item is completed & expiration time is past"
  * if task.expired && task.complete => remove Task
  * if task.expired && !task.complete => show Task
  * if !task.expired && task.complete => (UsualBehavior) => remove Task

# 2. Communicative UI
"Style items based on their urgency"

# 3. Stats in UI
"Keep track of the percentage of tasks that are completed on time"

# 4. Responsive Component Design
"Make the UI responsive and a joy to use on any device"
