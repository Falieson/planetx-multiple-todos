# NOTE
Updated the structure to represent `commit: 3.C.3) Data: Denormalize to Multiple Collections`, for more info start with `/docs/CommitJournal.md`, then go to `Project.md`.

Basic structure supplied by [Meteor 1.3 Guide - App Structure (Link, 20160601)](http://guide.meteor.com/structure.html)

Final Structure based on collaboration with Stackoverflow and Gitter/meteor#meteor and many tutorials.
